Just a compilation for my own reference of scripts I've writtenn.  Included are production examples (mostly Microsoft SQL Server) of:

1)  Removing duplication from a table.
2)  Dynamic SQL using system metadata tables.
3)  Transaction/Error handling and rollback.
4)  Loading user defined data from an excel spreadsheet to a temp table.
5)  Utilization of symetric key encryption.
6)  Stored procedure templates.
7)  Lots of random things I should probably clean up.
