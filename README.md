Just a compilation of scripts I've written for my own reference.  Makes it easy for things I can't code off the top of my head, and may be useful to somebody somewhere....  

Included are production examples in Microsoft SQL Server of:

1)  Removing duplication from a table.
2)  Dynamic SQL using system metadata tables.
3)  Transaction/Error handling and rollback.
4)  Loading user defined data from an excel spreadsheet to a temp table.
5)  Utilization of symetric key encryption.
6)  Stored procedure templates.
7)  Lots of random things I should probably clean up.
